	<p><a href=index.html>Volante</a> : <a href=devguideindex.html> Volante Developer's Guide</a> : <b>History of Volante</b></p>

	<p>Volante is a continuation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perst">Perst</a> database originally created by <a href="http://www.garret.ru/">Konstantin Knizhnik</a>.<p>

	<p>Up to version 2.49 Perst was licensed under BSD. Konstantin (I assume) sold the code to a company called McObject. Starting with version 2.50 the license was changed to GPL and McObject sells a commercial license for people who can't use GPL code.<p>

	<p>Volante is based on the latest BSD version (2.49) and retains its BSD license, which allows free use even in commercial software.</p>

	<p>Perst has Java and .NET versions but at the moment I don't have the bandwidth to support both versions (and I don't actively use Java) so currently Volante only has .NET version.</p>

	<p>Perst 2.49 was released long time ago (in 2005) so I decided to make some changes in the code base without worrying about backwards compatibility with Perst.</p>
	
	<p>You can read a <a href="https://github.com/kjk/volante/blob/master/csharp/changelog-volante.txt">detailed changelog</a> but to summarize most important changes and why they were made:
	<ul>
		<li>renamed interfaces to follow C# naming style</li>
		<li>renamed Storage class to Database</li>
		<li>excluded XML import/export and replication functionality from official build. My focus is to best support the use case of using Volante as a storage engine for desktop/mobile applications and in that usage those features aren't useful</li>
		<li>excluded old btree code from official build. Perst has 2 versions of btree code. I don't know why (probably the old code is kept for backwards compatibility) but the new btree code seems to be better (faster) so I removed the old btree. The result is smaller dll and less code to maintain</li>
	</ul>
